  The magnatronic thrusters coughed and the space freighter jerked.

"Dammit!" Captain Drakaru said. \"#{user_1_tweets[0]}.\" He scratched at the dark bristles around the horns on 
either side of his chin. "I can't believe \"#{user_1_tweets[1]}.\" The door glided open, hissing to its stops before sliding closed 
again.

  \"#{user_2_tweets[0]},\" said Wegs Rylar. Drakaru's second in command
leaned forward, inspecting the engine. He folded all of his arms, his top two hands
tucking under his armpits; the lower ones resting across his stomach. \"#{user_2_tweets[1]}.\" But I digress. Is
there something wrong with the magnatron?"

  "Hell damn yes there's something damn wrong with the damn magnatron!", said Drakaru. "Do you think I'm staring at the engine and
cussing for no damn good reason?" He paused, his nostrils pulsing in time with the heaves of his chest.
"Well?! Are you just going to stand there or are you going to say something useful?"

  Wegs looked to the ceiling, scrunching his lips and then said, \"#{user_2_tweets[2]}.\"

  "What in the jumped-up-jeknar-holy-wazgurl-poop are you talking about, man?!" Drakaru's mouth twisted as he
raised his hands in front of him with his palms up. Wegs met Drakaru's eyes and frowned. He shrugged four shoulders,
extended his arms, and flicked out one of the two thick fingers on each of his hands.

  "How dare you treat your captain that way?!", Drakaru said. He sidestepped Wegs, scowling at his lieutenant as he
circled toward the door. "These are the last words that you're gonna hear as a free Garnok, so I'd listen up if I
was you. Drakaru paused, letting the weight of his words sink in. \"#{user_1_tweets[2]}!\"

  Drakaru raised his brow and stared at Wegs, hoping his gaze would add weight to his sermon. He gripped
Wegs by one of his arms. "You're going to the brig for saying stupid crap." Drakaru jerked Wegs through the door, cutting hard right and
disappearing into the depths of the ship as the door hissed shut.
